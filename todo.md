random seeds

ideas
- make pol, make qfunc (not initialize)
- hyperparameters should be loaded in (experiment class?)
- some things are added to hyperparameters...
- where does buffer live?
- optimizers should be dict

runner
- counters can hold rewards as well - runner class?
- writer
- counter
- hyperparameters

wanted func
- start experiment from file
- restart experiment from checkpoint (based on tests)
